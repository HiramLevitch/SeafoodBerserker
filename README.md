Forget ninjas. Forget fruit. The Vikings need your help to defeat the seafood! 
This is best Heavy-Metal Viking-themed fish-slaughter game you\'ve ever played.

This game is not really finished, and probably has a lot of bugs, but I hope you enjoy it anyway!

See a demo of it [on youtube](https://youtu.be/_1qAJ96vnpQ), or download it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quaap.fishberserker) or soon on [F-Droid|https://f-droid.org/].
